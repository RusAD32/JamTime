/*

The dungeon is initially generated empty and contains only hallways and dead-end cells.
Use one of the insert commands to replace a dead end cell with a custom cell.

* insert_start_room()
* insert_finish_room()
* insert_key_room()
* insert_lock_room()
* insert_locked_finish_room()
* insert_start_and_finish()

Note that the custom cell can only be inserted into the dungeon if
there is an available dead end cell to be replaced.

So code your locked doors in such a way that they are unlocked 
automatically if no key for them was generated.
